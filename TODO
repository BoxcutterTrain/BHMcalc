 The Binary Habitability Mechanism Calculator
 The Playground of Planetary Astronomers
 2014 [)] Jorge Zuluaga - Viva la BHM!
################################################################################

To Do
=====

- Generate random CBPS.

- When a "single-star binary" be simulated does not show the Star 2 and
  Binary tabs.

- Make a "single-star binary".

- Hide extra parameters from input forms to avoid confusion.

- Include plot of range of composition and masses for giant planet models

- Avoid to change the original catalogue when a user has just entered
  the site.

- Put the values of the factor to multiply fluxes in order to have
  mass-losses.

- PDF figures

- Copy to clipboard

- Increase resolution in metallicity 

- Include help windows pop-up

- Record a video explaining the usage of the calculator.

- Fast links to interesting results.

- Allow to update automatically an object accoding to a given request
  (e.g. see the HZ of a system for illustration purposes).

- Correct catalogue according to findings using the calculator.

- Interpolate planetary properties taking into account differences in
  innercore formation.

- Include a complete list of other references in the About tab.

- Reference other calculators.

- Make a list of references for each physical model used in the
  calculator.

Done
====

- Create an administrator mode.

- Change the name of the figures in the replot feature to reload them
  properly.

- When regenerating the BHMcat create: a recalculation script able to
  recalculate all the objects in the calculator from the command line.

- Create a simplified mode where all the system be simulated with a
  single form. 

- Clarify f*B*

- Correct link of Zuluaga+2015 paper.

- Check other browsers (see Catalogue table).

- Compile information about each module as it was done with Star.

- Add a "News" or "Changeslog" section in the "About" page.

- Add a bug report floating form to report issues with given
  configurations.

- Remove link to "Download Configuration Files".  Only useful for
  advanced users and redundant with "Download All Files".

- Hide generate command line or restrict it only for admin users.

- Double check BHM Catalogue display when browser session is new.

- Logarithmic scale in the thermal and magnetic evolution of planets.

- Upload all the objects in the calculator tabs if they have been
  already calculated.

- Reduce the size of the URL for uploading a given configuration.

- Include a download images and html only link in the Summary tab.

Notes:
=====

To Do has been reset to a clean fresh file after major updates in the
calculator performed by the end of November 2014 in what has called
"BHMCalc2_1" version (git branch).  All the previous "To Do" and
"Done" issues have been left in previous versions of the package.
