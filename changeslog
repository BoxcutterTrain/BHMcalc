- Summary tab has been put as the first tab when a system of star is
  load and its result panel is loaded when the page is load.

- Modified configurations can be now saved for a given section.  They
  could also completely removed in case that something wrong happens
  or when the list of configuration is too large.

Changes log has been reset to a clean fresh file after major updates
in the calculator performed by the end of November 2014 in what has
called "BHMCalc2_1" version (git branch).  All the previous changes
log has been left in previous versions of the packages.
